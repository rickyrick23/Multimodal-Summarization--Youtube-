      "It's just how it is.\n",
      "And there's nothing that you can do to stop\n",
      "that.\n",
      "It's what you do after that will define where\n",
      "you go.\n",
      "When something I've invested...\n",
      "Thank you, thank you.\n",
      "When something I've invested in my heart and\n",
      "my soul, which I do with everything that I\n",
      "actually put my mind to, if that fails, I\n",
      "don't just wallow in self-pity.\n",
      "I roll myself in it.\n",
      "I roll around in it.\n",
      "I wrap myself in it, head to toe, self-pity,\n",

      "I can tell you that.\n",
      "My mother who's sitting right here has witnessed\n",
      "it many times.\n",
      "But then I get up, cry a little, dust myself\n",
      "off and dive straight back into life.\n",
      "Because the only way to push failure aside\n",
      "is to move ahead, not ignore it, analyze it\n",
      "and learn from it.\n",
      "Always remember, you will never truly enjoy\n",
      "success until you have tasted failure.\n",
      "And trust me when I tell you, it tastes like\n",
      "shit, really does.\n",
      "So, rule number six, fail, fail, fail again,\n",
      "and then rise like a Phoenix.\n",
      "Now what is life without a little bit of a\n",
      "risk, right?\n",
      "No, I'm not an adrenaline junkie.\n",
      "I'm not telling you to go off roller coasters\n",
      "or anything.\n",
      "I've always believed that you have to take\n",
      "risks, calculated, educated risks to evolve.\n",
      "Because if you've not truly explored the full\n",
      "extent of your possibilities, you'll always\n",
      "remain stagnant.\n",
      "People have written me off several times in\n",
      "my career.\n",
